Object-Oriented Programming Questions & Answers
---
### Main principles of OOP

**1. Encapsulation**
  
  Encapsulation provides objects the ability to `hide` the object `internal state` and `behavior`.
   - Internal state the object is protected by `hidding its attributes`
   - The behavior is protected by `access modifires` like `private, protected and publik`
   - Provides `public interface` with `private implementation`

**2. Polymorphism**
  
  Polymorphism objects the ability behavior for the same `action/message` with different, object specific implementation of the `behavior`.
  The principle implemented by so called `Dynamic binding` or `late binding` mechanism. In this technique which of the object `behavior` should 
  be selected decide on `run time`.
  
**3. Inheritance**
  
   - Inheritance provides ability to extend state, behavior child objects from their parent.
   - Provides reusable of parent code without modifying parent code

**4. Abstraction**
  
  Abstraction can be achieved by `abstract classes and interfaces`.
    - Abstraction provides general contract for the object behavior

###SOLID - class/object design principles
 - Single Responsibility
 - Open for extension Close for modification
 - Liskov Substitution
 - Dependency Inversion
